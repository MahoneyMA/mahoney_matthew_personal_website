# Wow.

With the season moments from coming to a very disappointing end for **Liverpool**,
the most unlikely thing in the history of the club happened. And when I say that I am not exaggerating as it has **never** happened before.  
## Before the 16th of May, 2021, no Liverpool goalkeeper had ever scored a Premier League goal, and no goalkeeper had scored a game-winning goal.  
And what a time to do it too, as Alisson kept our hopes of a top 4 finish alive by doing the job our 10 outfield players made look impossible. After falling behind early to **West Brom**, we managed to miss from every conceivable angle and distance throughout the 90 minutes. **Mo Salah** pulled one back, but joined in on the hijinks that has defined our season and landed us in 5th place with 3 games left to play. It felt like every player in red managed to get themselves into a promising position without even troubling the goalkeeper.  
### That is, until a player not in red decided that he had seen enough.  
Up came **Alisson Becker**, into the penalty area, and into the history books.

I cannot think of a more deserving player either. After having lost his father months ago in a tragic accident in a worldwide pandemic that prevented him from having a proper chance to say goodbye, Alisson Becker has had a moment that I hope will bring him as much joy as it brought me.  
Also the header was boss.
