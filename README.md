This is my personal website. I am regularly updating it and regularly using it as a place to implement new ideas and practice skills, as well as give information about myself.

You can also find me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/matthew-mahoney-4275b6190/), or can contact me directly via email me at mahoney.a.matthew@gmail.com

This website is made with React, using [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) as a framework.
